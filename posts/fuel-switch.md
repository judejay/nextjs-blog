## Introduction

The remote fuel switch is only provided on the European models of the RC36.
Therefore there is limited information available on many resources.
It allows for the selection of either ON, OFF or RESERVE at the 12 O'clock, 3 O'clock & 6 O'clock positions respectively frm the left hand top fairing of the cockpit. It works by means of a two cable system that activates the fuel tap under the petrol tank.

## Important

The fuel switch should be set to OFF position before dismantling.
The arrow of the fuel tap should be pointing forwards.

## Challenges of Remote Fuel Switch

- It is mounted on the fairing
- The actuator mechanism is likely to be seized
- The cables may not be moving freely

## Removal from the vehicle

The easiest way to remove it is to release the screw that is holding the actuator mechanism to the dial and pop the cables away from the bracket. Then when the top fairing is removed the bracket will come with it, if it still attached.
Mine wasn't attached as two of the bosses were missing from the fairing, the other one was attached by the screw to the boss, which was snapped off from the fairing.

## Replacing the bosses

The bosses are like three fingers the point into the fairing and contained in each is well nut that takes an M5 screw.
The well nuts can be bought as:

Honda Motorcycle Windshield Fairing Rubber Well Nuts Washer M5.

    You don't need the rubber, just heat it with a heat gun and slice the rubber, the well nut should just pop out!

With three well nuts and three screws going through the bracket, the position of the bosses should be established.

Fix the well nuts to the fairing, I used expanding glue, release the screws before the glue fully cures, this will depend on the
product you used, but something like two hours for what I used. At this point cut away any excess product. Use of plasticine
can give a disposable mold for the glue to expand into. Further strengthening of your new bosses can be done with fibre glass/GRP product. Allow to fully cure for over 48 hours before reassembling. Cutting away any excess is much easier with the GRP dried.

## Overhaul Mechanism

The mechanism has a couple of washers, these can be replaced with a kit or just the corrosion on the washers removed by wire wool/wet & dry paper. Or you put in citric acid solution overnight, that's lemon juice!
Point some penetrating spray down the cable, it will come out the other side.

## Re-assembling

1. Fit the bracket to the fairing.
2. Fit the fairing to the bike.
3. Attach the mechanism to the bracket.
4. Locate the cables to bracket.

## Conclusion

Repairing the bosses with modern chemical engineering can be done to allow reserve fuel, off & on to be remotely activated from the cockpit.
